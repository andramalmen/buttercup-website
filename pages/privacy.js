            <h2>What is Buttercup</h2>
            <p>
              Buttercup is a password and credentials manager, which is made up by several applications and services.
              Secure information (passwords and other stored login details) are encrypted and stored in{' '}
              <strong>archive files</strong>. These archive files are used by the various software applications provided
              by Buttercup. Archives may be synchronised between multiple devices using either a user-operated hosting
              service or a <strong>My Buttercup</strong> hosted account.
            </p>

            <h3>Archive Encryption and Security</h3>
            <p>
              Archives are encrypted using extremely strong modern encryption methods by using a password provided by
              the user. Files are encrypted <u>on the user’s device</u> before being synchronised using any of services
              mentioned earlier. Archives can only be decrypted by using the user’s secret password. There is no way to
              bypass encryption or to open the archive without the original password. The user is responsible for their
              password choice in terms of strength.
            </p>

            <h2>What data is provided to and used by Buttercup</h2>
            <p>
              Buttercup uses only the bare minimum information necessary to function in a user-friendly manner. No data
              is shared with or sold to 3rd parties.
            </p>

            <h3>Using 3rd party synchronisation</h3>
            <p>
              When using a synchronisation method outside of My Buttercup, no user-specific information is requested or
              stored. Any data entered by the user in any of the Buttercup applications is kept in that application and
              not transferred from the user’s device. Contents in the user’s archive(s) is always encrypted using their
              secret password before being stored in a user-chosen synchronisation service.
            </p>
            <p>
              Buttercup software collects anonymous analytics to help improve the platform. No user-identifiable data is
              collected and IP addresses are anonymized (last digits are zeroed).
            </p>

            <h3>Using My Buttercup accounts and synchronisation</h3>
            <p>
              When using the hosted alternative, My Buttercup only stores the user’s email address and their
              securely-hashed password. All other information is optional and not specific to the user. Archives stored
              in the My Buttercup service are <u>already encrypted before they reach the My Buttercup servers</u> and
              are not accessible by anyone other than the user (with their password).
            </p>

            <h2>Buttercup application data use</h2>

            <h3>Buttercup desktop application</h3>
            <p>
              The desktop application allows users to create and use local/remote archives. Only the password, keyfile
              or both will be requested from the user - these are used to encrypt and decrypt their archive file. The
              user may be prompted for their synchronisation account information for storing the archive and this
              information is stored locally in encrypted form. The archive itself may be synchronised using a file sync
              service (like Dropbox/ownCloud etc.) of the user’s choice using their own account. The archive that is
              written to the synchronisation service is already encrypted before sending.
            </p>
            <p>
              No unencrypted data is written to the archive. No user information is written to the archive besides the
              credentials they choose to store in the archive.
            </p>

            <h3>Buttercup browser extension</h3>
            <p>
              The browser extension allows users to create and use remote archives. Only the master password and archive
              name is requested from the user when adding an archive. The user may be requested for cloud
              synchronisation information for use with their choice of file synchronisation service provider, and these
              details are stored locally in encrypted form.
            </p>
            <p>
              No unencrypted data is written to the archive. No user information is written to the archive besides the
              credentials they choose to store in the archive.
            </p>

            <h3>Buttercup mobile application</h3>
            <p>
              The mobile app allows users to create and use local/remote archives. Only the master password is requested
              from the user when creating or opening their archive. The user may be requested for cloud synchronisation
              information for use with their choice of file synchronisation service provider, and these details are
              stored locally in encrypted form. The archive itself may be synchronised using a file sync service (like
              Dropbox/ownCloud etc.) of the user’s choice using their own account. The archive that is written to the
              synchronisation service is already encrypted before sending.
